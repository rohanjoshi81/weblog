Malware (MALicious softWARE) describes any piece of code ( script or software ) designed to infect your computer and cause problems like resource hogging or doing undesired things such as mass-mail spam, steal passwords, spy on your browsing history. This post will be a general walk-through for Malware protection and diagnosis .

- PREVENTION : Malware spread through internet while installing some program or clicking some ad. Ever saw a new search bar or a Google look-alike homepage on your web browser! This can be a typical case of malware(spyware) infection. Almost all freeware softwares try to install additional software on your system which may very well be spyware or adware. Most common examples are the ubiquitous toolbars or antivirus. Recently, while installing FileZilla from their official site (SourceForge) i encountered adware!. So, be careful of what you are installing and check if the freeware you are downloading is from a official or legitimate source and find out about MD5-Checksum! Another common cause of malware is ads which are on every nook and corner of internet. Although most legitimate sites filter and screen out their ads but it’s not uncommon to find ads that pop open and  try to woo you in downloading executables. The best way is to avoid clicking the ads and use browser extensions to block or hide ads like Adblock Plus.

- CURE : No matter how defensive you are against malware, your system may get infected with malware one way or another. In case you observe your browser having unknown home page/bookmark/search engine or Windows applications freezing your PC may very well be infested. You should uninstall any recently installed  application which might be causing issue and also use a malware scanner. I can recommend [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) , it has a free version and worked well for me.


For better security, whenever you want to try a new software and are not really sure of the origin use a Sandbox program for downloading and installing. A “sandbox” is an isolated virtual environment where you can securely open suspicious programs/files. Try [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/sandboxie/)
