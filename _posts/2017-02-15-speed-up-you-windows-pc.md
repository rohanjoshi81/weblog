Everyone knows that with time even an expensive Windows PC will become sluggish. It occurs due to various factors such as temporary files, disk fragmentation, dumps etc. This post will guide you through ways to remove these problems and make your old ( or new ) Windows PC optimized to work at near 100% efficiency.

- DISK CLEAN UP : With time your storage drive gets filled with unnecessary temporary files and system error logs / dumps that waste your HDD space and also hinder performance . You can use Windows’ built-in cleanup functions to create more space: they do so by emptying the Recycle Bin, and removing temporary and other files you no longer need.

In Windows 7 Go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, then choose System Tools, Disk Cleanup. (or Right Click on a drive > Properties > General > Disk CleanUp

In Windows 8 go to the Search Charm and type in Disk Clean-up. Click on the result for ‘Clear Disk Space by deleting unnecessary files’.

The wizard will identify the files it thinks you can delete, also telling you how much hard-drive space it will free up. Click ‘View files’ if you want to check which files are being deleted and save any file you don’t want to delete .

Even though I use Disk Cleanup regularly, i was able to free up 946 MB of data, check out how much you can free !

- REMOVE UNNECESSARY Software : Many windows users have a bad habit of installing every utility software they can find and then forget about it after using for once, cluttering the Program files and registry. A scheduled checkup of softwares no longer in use can really improve you PC performance and also help in Malware control as many of these softwares are not regularly updated and become vulnerable to attacks.

Go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program . You can sort the list by “Last Used On” option to help decide which programs you may no more need .

- DE-FRAGMENT DISK :

```
Warning : Don’t do this on a SSD !
```

Defragging or defragmenting your hard drive is another way of speeding up your Windows computer. The principle behind is that of Fragmentation of disk : As data is saved and re-saved to your hard drive, small packets of information are deposited in random places all over the platter. This then takes longer to read, when Windows calls upon your hard drive to find out information.

By defragmenting or compacting that data the operating system removes the gaps between packets of data, moving it all closer to the middle of the disc. This in turn makes each access of the hard drive quicker, by a really tiny amount !

In Windows 7, Start >All Programs >Accessories >System Tools >Disk Defragmenter.

In Windows 8 your PC, laptop or tablet will defrag itself by default every week, thanks to the scheduled task: Optimize Drives. So if you haven’t changed any settings, you shouldn’t need to defrag.

In the defragmenter , click on a partition , ” Analyze ” then if the partition is fragmented by 10% or more ” Optimize  ”

It should improve the speed of your PC or laptop, even if it does so by only an imperceptible amount (especially if you need that extra speed !) .

- REMOVING PROGRAMS FROM STARTUP : Startup contains a list of programs that automatically launch when windows starts so that you may use them without opening them discretely .But most of the time you only need a few of these programs . Shortening the Startup list is a proven effective method in speeding up your PC.

In Windows 7 , type msconfig in the Start menu Search > Startup > deselect programs that you don’t want to startup > Apply > OK

In Windows 8 , open Task Manager > Startup > click on the programs you don’t want to start with your PC > right-click > select ‘Disable’.
