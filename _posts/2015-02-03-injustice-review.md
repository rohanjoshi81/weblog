Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting game from the developers of  Mortal Kombat - NetherRealm Studios and builds upon the successful formula of Mortal Kombat with having a decent campaign and easy to learn combat! There was a time when PC gamers had to scavenge for a decent fighting game and use emulators to enjoy the genre. Injustice is a decent enough port to enjoy the game on PC and I have been playing it for couple months now.

The main campaign of game is awesome and not just for DC fans, it is much more better than what you expect from a fighting game. As for DC fans, they will be  already familiar with the Injustice storyline which has been going on in comics for several years. The story sees our favorite superheroes playing skipping stones on parallel universes to fight with their alternate versions. The story mode lets you play different character in each chapter making you familiar with moveset and progressing the story from different viewpoints.

Injustice features almost every popular superhero the DC roster. Alongside favorites like Superman, Batman and Joker, you can play with Green Arrow, Flash, Green Lantern, Bane, Zatanna and many more characters . Each character provides unique fighting experience and can be loosely classified into fast-paced characters (Flash , Batgirl) , Superpower rich characters (Superman , Shazam , Martian) , Brutes (Bane , Doomsday ) and more. 

The gameplay is easier when compared to other fighter titles especially the 3D ones, and is easy to pick up and play casually. Like the famous MK fatalities  each character in Injustice has an unique ultra move that provides some cool cut-scenes. You can watch Superman flying to the orbit to knock down opponent, Flash giving a 'around the globe punch' and Joker playing with a pie and a rocket launcher! Stages also include interactive elements like launchers that fire, cars to grab and throw, barrels to roll, water blasts and more. On the top of all this, stages also have secondary levels allowing you to transition to alternate arena with a well timed hit.

Regarding multiplayer, I was not able to find any online mathces for my region but the game can be enjoyed offline in couch coop if you have friends.

The overall visuals are stunning if you talk about the stage and cutscenes but few of the character builds are not that great and could've been better. Being that said the graphics along with the gameplay provide fluid and non-stop action making Injustice a recommendable fighting game.
