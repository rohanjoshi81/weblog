One of the most popular operating system Microsoft Windows XP, will stop getting any support after April 2014. It is almost a decade old now and is still very popular because of its simple user interface, easy multiple windows handing feature and utility applications. The company now requests users to upgrade it to Windows 8.1 to avoid vulnerabilities due to security risks and viruses. Between the impending loss of support for Windows XP next year and the recent revelation that PCs running Windows XP are the ones most commonly infected with malware, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for people to hang with the aged versions of Windows operating systems. There’s a newly discovered exploit out there that affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer on both Windows 7 and Windows XP. So what can you do to protect yourself from this Internet Explorer vulnerability? Well, you could switch to Windows 8/8.1, or you can go the free route and just use an open source Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, or Safari.

What does this mean..??

1.Over 34,000 branches of Indian public sector banks would become vulnerable as the popular Windows XP operating system would no longer be supported by Microsoft in about 150 days, shows a study conducted by the software giant.

2.An unsupported version of Windows will no longer receive software updates from Windows Update. These include security updates that can help protect your PC from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software, which can steal your personal information. After April 8, 2014, technical assistance for Windows XP will no longer be available, including automatic updates that help protect your PC.

So it’s time for you to Upgrade if you have still have not

# What’s New and Exciting with Windows 8.1

- Return of the Start Button : The Start button won’t show you the Start menu as it was in earlier version of Windows instead it just brings up the Start screen. It’s a minor feature but nice if you’re used to clicking that button in the bottom left-hand corner. Plus, with the new All Apps view, it makes the Start menu more usable on the desktop.

- Powerful Multitasking : One of Windows 8′s best features is the side-by-side window snapping i.e you can open multiple apps on  splitted parts of the same window screen , now you can resize those snapped windows however you want. Earlier, you could only have Windows split 50/50, or into thirds. Now, you can actually drag the slider to make each app take up as much or as little space as you want. Furthermore, you can have more than two apps or windows on-screen at once

- Boot to Desktop : Boot to desktop does exactly what it sounds like: You can tell Windows 8 to boot straight to the desktop instead of going to the Start screen first. To access it, just right-click on the taskbar and head to Properties > Navigation > When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of Start. This will also bring you back to the desktop whenever you close a Modern app, which is handy if you use one every once in awhile.

- SkyDrive Integrated with File Explorer : SkyDrive is free online storage that’s built into Windows 8.1. Save documents, photos, and other files to SkyDrive automatically, and get to them anytime, from any of your PCs or devices. And you can use SkyDrive to protect your files if something happens to your PC.You can also use SkyDrive to share and collaborate with others, and see your stuff on mobile and non-Windows devices. Not only can you save all your files to SkyDrive by default and keep them in sync, but it’s integrated with File Explorer . When you first launch the File Explorer you’ll see a SkyDrive option in the left sidebar. This doesn’t automatically store all your SkyDrive files locally—instead, you can open any SkyDrive-stored file right from this section when you’re online, or right-click to save an offline version. It seems to replace Libraries, though you can bring those back if you want them. And, if you don’t use SkyDrive at all, you can turn it off entirely as well.

- An Improved Win+X Menu : The Win+X Menu has also gotten a few little updates that makes it a bit more useful. Most notably, Microsoft has added the ability to shut down from the Win+X menu. Just press Win+X or right-click on the Start button and choose Shut Down from the menu. This is much faster than Windows 8′s previous method of shutting down, which required you to open the charms menu. They’ve also replaced the Command Prompt options with PowerShell ,though you can bring back the Command Prompt option if you want

- Internet Explorer 11 : Microsoft has added a feature to IE11, giving users the option to always show your tabs and touch-optimized address bar. Users can even have 100 tabs open without eating up resources or causing a slowdown of the browser. In fact, you can even access your open tabs across devices. Pinned sites in IE11 are now made as Live Tiles on your Start Screen, pulling data from a websites RSS feed so you can constantly be updated. Another cool feature in IE11 is the ability to have IE11 automatically Snapped to the side when clicking a link in the Mail app or Reading List app. IE11 also automatically detects and highlights phone numbers on a page, allowing you to use Skype or Lync to make a call easily.
