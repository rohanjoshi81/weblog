Finally got some time to write a short review on Assassin’s Creed franchise latest installment Black Flag. After the sad AC III launch (Bugs ahoy !) expectations from Ubisoft were high on the 6th AC title and Ubisoft kept the promise and delievered a really nice game. Though the game has less to do with the creed of Assassin’s and follows the “Black Flags” ( the title could infact have been Pirates of Caribbean ) but it delivers hours of fun gameplay !

The game tells the tragic story of an Englishman Edward Kenway who turns to high seas for riches and gold and becomes a pirate, a templar and an assassin! The story is kinda good (if you put aside the fact that it has very less to do with the creed). The story follows Kenway and fellow pirates in their search for gold and paradise .

The gameplay is where the game shines. The weapon system has been simplified since Revelations and you can use the vast array of weapons quite easily. The AI is also improved and the gunners get more power ( Riflemen can be a real pain in butt ). Though the track/chase missions are dull but the game is spiked with some exciting missions. The main attraction of the game is the naval battles, the game becomes immersive naval sim as soon as you are on your ship’s deck, chasing multiple schooner, brigs or running from a man o’ war with your crew singing shanties! The game incorporates elements of Far Cry like hunting as well. Though the cities are not as big as in previous titles which leads to less parkour, the ocean is vast and has almost infinte islands where you can hunt or dock your ship to search for treasures.

The games graphics are awesome as expected from AAA game and even on low-mid settings on my 7670M the game looked pretty awesome. The music of the game is very matching and really gives you the feeling of being a pirate. The game is intended to provide about 50+ hours of gameplay (for 100% completion offline). I completed the main story at 46% in around 20 hours and am still exploring the high seas.

Although the game is quire fun but hardcore AC fans might find the story too shallow or unrelated compared to Ezio trilogy.

All things said I would highly recommend this game.
